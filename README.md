Just a bit of background. I have had no experience with coding at all. I was completely overwhelmed in the beginning and I had a hard time getting started. After many "false starts" and lots of research, I was able to get started and acutally produce a website. 

I work at a nursing home and I used that website as a guide. www.nazhome.org.

Highlighting some of the features in my website for the required elements, I have:
1.  CSS Flex Box 4 column responsive layout
2.  CSS Nav Bar with hamburger
3.  Java requirement for hiding data on Nav Bar
4.  4 media queries
5.  Videos completed at 100%
6.  2 Online tech events
7.  Job readiness course completed
8.  32 Commits
9.  Since I was not able to validate the email, I did add a photo gallery to the about page. I will need to finalize the page by adding the nav bar to the top and some extra CSS features.

I do plan to keep building on this website for practice. I realize that it is quite simple, but it is a start. I would like to link muliple pages together from the Nav Bar. I had planned on trying to validate the email on the newsletter signup, but I just could not seem to get it and ran out of time.

Thank you for all of your help and patience. I enjoyed the class and hope to be able to use some of these new skills in the futre.
