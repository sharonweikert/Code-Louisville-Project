Just a bit of background. I have had no experience with coding at all. I was completely overwhelmed in the beggining (between work, kids and this course), I had a hard time getting started. 
In all honesty, I am no where near ready for a job in coding, but I am hopeful that with continued practice, I will be able to work towards that goal. I managed to get complete what I have done by watching the videos (alot) and lots of replication from things that I found on Google.
I work at a nursing home and I used that website as a guide. www.nazhome.org.
