Just a bit of background. I have had no experience with coding at all. I was completely overwhelmed in the beggining (between work, kids and this course), I had a hard time getting started. After many "false starts" and lost of research, I was able to get started and acutally produce a website. 

I work at a nursing home and I used that website as a guide. www.nazhome.org.

Highlighting some of the features in my website for the required elements, I have:
1.  CSS Flex Box 4 column responsive layout
2.  CSS Nav Bar with hamburger
3.  Java requirement for hiding data on Nav Bar
4.  5 media queries
5.  Videos completed at 100%
6.  2 Online tech events
7.  Job readiness course completed
